# BatchRename
With this application you can rename and sort large amounts of photos and other files at once using a specific pattern.  
It is especially useful for photos with stored *EXIF data*. For example, you can move the file `Camera-Uploads\0024.jpg` to `2015\06\2015-06-25_12-34-02.jpg` automatically!

## Download
See [Releases](https://github.com/Dargmuesli/batchrename/releases "Releases").
